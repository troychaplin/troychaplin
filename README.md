# Hi I'm Troy ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior frontend developer who loves designing, developing and building React component libraries and turning them into feature rich custom Gutenberg blocks that seamlessly integrate into the core Gutenberg editing experience.

I currently contribute about 10-15 hours a week towards contributions to Gutenberg and the WordPress Developer Blog and I would like to become more involved in the themes and design teams in the future. Part of my time is currently sponsored by Kinsta.

I addition to this I maintain a [Block Accessibility Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-accessibility-checks/) plugin and I enjoy building tools and starter packages aimed to help developers, such as a [multi-block starter plugin](https://github.com/troychaplin/multi-block-starter), and a [monorepo manager](https://github.com/troychaplin/wp-monorepo-manager) for dependency and asset management.
