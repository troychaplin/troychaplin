# Hi I'm Troy ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Senior Web Developer at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/webservices/), where I lead the development of our enterprise WordPress platform and steward the digital web brand through [Ravens Design System (RDS)](https://github.com/cuweb/rds), a React component library powering a consistent, accessible user experience across the institutionâ€™s websites.

Iâ€™m also a passionate WordPress enthusiast who enjoys designing and developing React component libraries and transforming them into feature-rich custom Gutenberg blocks that seamlessly integrate into the editing experience.

I contribute 10â€“15 hours a week to Gutenberg and the WordPress Developer Blog, with part of my time sponsored by [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/). Iâ€™m also the maintainer of the [Block Accessibility Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-accessibility-checks/) plugin and enjoy building tools and starter packages to help other developers, including a [multi-block starter plugin](https://github.com/troychaplin/multi-block-starter) plugin and a [monorepo manager](https://github.com/troychaplin/wp-monorepo-manager) for dependency and asset management.
